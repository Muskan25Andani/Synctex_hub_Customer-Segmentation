This project implements a Spam SMS Detection system that classifies messages as spam or ham using Machine Learning. Text messages are preprocessed, converted to numerical features with TF-IDF / CountVectorizer, and classified with Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression. The trained model is evaluated and saved for future use.
